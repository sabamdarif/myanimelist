"""Settings used by the test suite.

pytest-django calls django.setup() while loading its plugin — before any
conftest.py is imported — so the environment has to be pinned here, at import
time of the settings module itself. This gives the tests a known SECRET_KEY
(JWT signing needs one, and CI has no .env), SQLite instead of whatever
DATABASE_URL a developer has locally, and no HTTPS redirect. load_dotenv() in
settings.py does not override variables that already exist, so these win.
